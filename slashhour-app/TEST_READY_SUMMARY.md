// Add inside Stack.Navigator
<Stack.Screen

  component={UXFeaturesTestScreen}
  options={{ title: '🧪 UX Features Test' }}
/>
```

### Step 3: Add Navigation Button (1 minute)

Open **`src/screens/profile/ProfileScreen.tsx`** and temporarily add:

```typescript
import { Button } from 'react-native';

// Add this button somewhere visible (top of screen)
<Button
  title="🧪 Test UX Features"
  onPress={() => navigation.navigate('UXTest' as never)}
/>
```

**Then:**
1. Reload app (shake device → "Reload")
