1. Problem Statement

The Inflation Crisis Meets Discovery Breakdown

Consumer Pain Points:
- Rising Costs of Essentials: Food up 20%, clothing up 15%, electronics up 18%
- Deals Exist But Hidden: Local shops post deals on social media but only 2% of followers see them
- Fragmented Discovery: Need to check Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, plus 10+ deal apps
- Missing Daily Savings: "My local grocery had 30% off produce - found out after it expired"

Small Business Pain Points:
- Can't Reach Customers: Restaurant posts lunch special to 5,000 followers → 100 see it
- Essential Goods Spoiling: Groceries, prepared food, seasonal clothing going to waste
- High Marketing Costs: $200/day for Facebook ads with poor ROI for small shops
- Competition from Big Chains: Local shops can't compete with large retailer marketing budgets

Market Reality:
"I follow my neighborhood grocery, favorite restaurants, and local clothing shops on Instagram. I never
see their deals. Meanwhile, I'm spending 30% more on essentials." - Consumer Research

"We throw away $500 of groceries daily. We post deals on Facebook but nobody sees them." - Local Grocery
